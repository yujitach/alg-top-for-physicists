1. General Introduction

various subfields of math vs. physics

use of algebraic topology in particular

- Dirac monopole and Hop

- homotopy and topological solitons

- index theorem and anomalies in QFT ( diff. geom aspects were emphasized then)

- 1st Chern class and TKNN formula

- Chern-Simons theory and quantum Hall effect

- K-theory in string theory (but debatable if it's physics)

- K-theory and topological insulators / superconductors

- symmetry-protected topological phases and generalized cohomology theories

- general understanding of anomalies in QFT

Systematically learning algebraic topology seems useful at this point
